## Installing Components using a Scratch Org

1. Set up your environment. Follow the steps in the [Quick Start: Lightning Web Components](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/quick-start-lightning-web-components/) Trailhead project. The steps include:

-   Enable Dev Hub in your Trailhead Playground
-   Install Salesforce CLI
-   Install Visual Studio Code
-   Install the Visual Studio Code Salesforce extensions, including the Lightning Web Components extension

2. If you haven't already done so, authenticate with your hub org and provide it with an alias (**myhuborg** in the command below):

```
sfdx force:auth:web:login -d -a myhuborg
```

3. Clone the pdfViewer repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/firione/pdfViewer
cd pdfViewer
```

4. Create a scratch org and provide it with an alias (**pdfViewer** in the command below):

```
sfdx force:org:create -s -f config/project-scratch-def.json -a pdfViewer

### Pre-requisite
Before any coding, we need to set the expected behavior of opening a PDF file in **Setup**, otherwise we might accidentally download the file instead of view it. Go to **Setup → Security → File Upload and Download Security**, find the **.pdf** label, click the **Edit** button, and set the picklist value of the pdf to **Execute In Browser.**

All set? Let's add the components to the respective pages!

### Directions to add a PDF viewer component to an App or Home page

1. Go to an App or Home page. Click on the **Setup** icon on the top left, then click **Edit Page**.

2. Drag the **showPdfById** component onto the page.

3. In the **Lightning App Builder**, set **youTubeId** field to the desired PDF File's Content Document ID. Where do you find such an ID? Go to **File --> Desired File --> Download**, then get the ID in the browser. The url format should be like this *HOST/sfc/servlet.shepherd/document/download/FILE_ID*

4. Optionally you can set the height of the PDF with **Height in rem**. The PDF is not rendered yet. Check there is no error message. Click **Save**, then **Back**.

5. Enjoy your PDF on the App or Home page!
